The service worker allows the app to work seamlessly in offline mode, you can test it in a browser dev tools by enabling offline mode in the application tab. Moreover, I cached all the necessary files for better user experience such as all the HTML pages, CSS styles, JavaScript files for interactivity. Finally, the app is installable, thanks to the manifest file which contains all the required information such as the app name, background and theme color and app's icon in different sizes.
